Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
  Artemis Financial is a consulting company developing financial plans for their customers. The company wanted to modernize its business making accessing and securing vital customer information easier for both parties involved. Artemis Financial needed help securing this   information to prevent any breaches in data.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  After finding Artemis Financials software securit vulnerabilities it was easier to then go in and fix up those patches. Its important to code securely to ensure the security breaches don't pop up with a loop hole or vulnerability within your code. Security breaches are an awful thing but they are much worse if the entire breach could've been avoided with proper coding. Software security is crucial to any company since it keeps the entire company's important information secure from users that don't have permissions or access to it.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  Learning more about vulnerability assessment and security was facsinating but a newer topic for me. It took me some more time to get everything through my head but in the end I made it.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  I utilized mavens vulnerability check to go over any known breaches within the code. From here I was able to patch up those vulnerabilities and add additional security to the program. Maven is a very reliable source and one I will be using in my future.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  In order to maek certain the code and software application were functional without additional vulnerabilities I turned to Maven once again. I double check the code after the initial maven to check to go over one more time and ensure I didn't add additional vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  Maven is a tool I'll be using more of but always cracking down on my coding practices is important. Simple basics like running code every few lines, planning, and rereading my code are important to master for minimal vulernabilities and bugs.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  In the future I can use both project one and two to show my future employers what I'm capable of. These programs are good practice and make to round out my portfolio.
